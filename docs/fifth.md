## EDUCATION
### *by Janielle Marisse Samonte*

Face-to-face services like co-working spaces, flight services, and lodging were toppled down due to the pandemic. However, it’s not only these which were gravely affected. Because of the pandemic, the education sector was forced to shift from face-to-face to other variations and modes of classes. There’s blended-learning, home-schooling, distance-learning, and e-learning. But a lot of schools chose online learning as the main mode of learning.

Synchronous online classes became a temporary replacement for face-to-face discussions. To hold these kinds of sessions, of course, many used web conferencing applications like Zoom, Discord, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams just to name a few.

That said, **online classes paved the way for the usage of video conferencing software/applications.** 

There have been big investments for educational technology (EdTech) like video conferencing tools which reached a total of 18.66 billion dollars in 2019 (Li & Lalani, 2020). In line with this, it was observed that there’s a higher surge in EdTech usage this pandemic. More companies invest on new cloud servers to support online distance learning. For example, Alibaba’s distance learning solution involved tapping to more cloud storage to deploy more cloud servers within months. Thus, we can see that it is disruptive, especially this pandemic.
