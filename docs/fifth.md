# Web & Video Conferencing and Other Industries

## EDUCATION
### *by Janielle Marisse Samonte*

Face-to-face services like co-working spaces, flight services, and lodging were toppled down due to the pandemic. However, it’s not only these which were gravely affected. Because of the pandemic, the education sector was also forced to shift from face-to-face to other variations and modes of classes. To name a few, there is blended-learning, home-schooling, distance-learning, and e-learning. But a lot of schools chose e-learning or any online learning modality as the main mode of teaching.

Synchronous online classes became a temporary replacement for face-to-face discussions. To hold these kinds of sessions, of course, many used web conferencing applications like the following: 

- Zoom

These video web conferencing applications are said to be part of what we call Educational Technology or **EdTech** for short. These tools received big investments this 2019, and specifically it reached a total of **18.66 billion dollars** (Li & Lalani, 2020). That said, it is observed that the pandemic caused a high surge in EdTech usage since face-to-face classes is a no go for safety purposes. 

An example of EdTech widely used today would be Zoom which gained a worldwide traction not just from companies but also for remote learning ***(E-learning, Blended-learning, Distance Learning, etc.)***. It was founded in 2011 and was first a video conferencing company but they soon launched their own software in 2013 (Dai, 2020). However, it became most profitable in 2019. Then more used this app this pandemic. In addition, more companies also invest on new cloud servers to support online distance learning. An example that Li & Lalani (2020) stated that Alibaba’s distance learning solution involved tapping to more cloud storage to deploy more cloud servers within months. Thus, it is seen that **online classes paved the way for the usage of video conferencing software/applications and is deemed to be disruptive especially this pandemic.**  

## ENTERTAINMENT

Piracy is the greatest disruption to the entertainment industry and video conferencing is now used for piracy. Because of the pandemic, many artists opted  to stream their live performances/ concerts through the internet. Just like in the past, you need to buy tickets to be able to watch their performance, you will use the ticket to access the live stream and enjoy the show. But with the use of video conferencing platforms these live shows can be watched without buying a ticket. You just need to be part of a group chat and you will do a video conference, share the stream and let all members enjoy the show for free.

Discord for example, Discord is an instant messaging and digital distribution platform where users can communicate and share contents through servers. It is used by gamers to stream the game while they're playing. Or you can watch movies with friends. Because of these capabilities of the platform, it can also illegally stream contents without being caught since it's a private group/server.

Aside from these, the content sharing capabilities of video conferencing applications, just like video streaming, disrupts the markets of movie theaters and cable television. Instead of going out for a movie with friends or watching TV together, users can just use video conferencing platforms to do a video conference and share content.
