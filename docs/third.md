# Web & Video Conferencing and Working Spaces
### _by Yvonne Fudge Santos and Rajmyrr Suva_

_The pandemic has changed how the workforce operated worldwide. Many businesses closed as health protocols tightened. People were suddenly refrained from interacting with each other in the real world to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even news reporters–who did not stop a day of work–found a way to integrate their duties and set-up at their homes._

Many people have adapted and shifted to telecommuting or remote work, moving collaborative documents to online spaces, and meetings to video-conferencing applications. Most individuals utilized their spaces at home, and created a location in one of their rooms to be their designated work-place as the pandemic prolonged.

Thus, this did not only affect the corporate industries and its people, but has also impacted physical working spaces, co-working spaces, and other places that used to offer up their venues for rental for the workforce.


#### Working and Co-Working Spaces Before Pandemic

Working spaces were a norm in all industries in every country. Work-spaces are traditionally seen in an **office**.

A company or organization can have an office in a location where it has an official presence, even if that presence only includes a storage of products, rather than an official establishment with desks and chairs. The creation of offices dates back to the 18th century, right when the industrial era had become more developed; expanding banking, insurance, railways, petroleum, and many more industries. The role of an office is to create an environment to support its occupants in performing their job.

A **workspace** in an office generally fosters activities like reading, writing, printing, and computer work. 

An office may also provide meeting rooms, lounges, and even kitchens so workers can make their lunches.

As time progressed and start-ups and new business were developed, **co-working spaces** became a need. The essence of co-working started around 1999, in New York City when 42 West 24 provided flexible desks and working grounds for teams and individuals (Di Risio, 2021.) It was later further developed into the concept we know today in 2005 by Brad Neuberg (Neuberg, 2007). Neuberg was working at a start-up when he had the idea of co-working to combine the feeling of independence and community when working with others.

_Now, co-working spaces are places where anyone can work and be productive even if they belong to different corporations or industries._

A __co-working space__  is a flexible space that can act as an office for anyone, by providing resources like desks, tables, access to the internet, printers, charging panels, snacks, and more. In addition, it is like a metaphorical public library where anyone can learn, study, and work on their own–while still being part of an unsaid community. These have become popular worldwide, catering to the following:
- businessmen
- freelance workers
- start-up employees
- students

But because of the pandemic, the concept of going to an office or renting a co-working space had drastically changed. 


#### Work from Home in the Pandemic

The work from home set-up is not new, however it became the norm for corporations when COVID-19 had begun spreading across every country mid-March of 2020. People have started remotely working from their own house, and the industry completely shifted.

They’ve provided internet access to every worker, and sometimes given them company laptops and gadgets so that they can work from their houses with ease. Everyday meetings and conferences shifted from being scheduled to a room, to becoming web-conference calls via Zoom, Google Meets, Skype, and more.

The use of emails has also been utilized to its full potential. According to an email statistics report there have been 4.03 billion email users in 2019 (Radicati Group Inc., 2021). However, because of the pandemic there was a rapid increase of users and emails sent last 2020. It’s been reported that there were 300.4 billion emails sent and received per day. This 2021 alone, there were 5.59 billion active email accounts worldwide. (Statista, 2020.)

The use of email has become prevalent to communicate and coordinate with companies, workers, employees, businesses, clients, and more. But aside from emails, another well known mode of communication the workforce turned to are Web Conferencing applications and software.


#### Web Conferencing

Video conferencing is getting more and more common these days. With so many businesses and educational institutions using it for training classes and teleconferences, it has become an indispensable tool for employees. Telephone conferences, which were little more than simple phone talks, were the starting point for video conferencing decades ago. 

Picturephone was the name given to the technology when it was originally launched in 1968. Participants were allowed to communicate with the person on the other end of the line through video (Vyopta, 2018).

AT&T and Bell Labs were at the forefront of technological advancement since they were the only method of communication for decades on end (Patrizio, 2021). It was regarded as an expensive and low-quality method of conducting business. In recent years, digital technology has become less expensive and more effective.

Video conferencing is now easier than ever thanks to applications such as Skype or Google Hangouts, which can be accessed anywhere via your smartphone or computer. Moreover, software choices are now more varied than ever. Today, the most prevalent are Skype, Hangouts, and Zoom - all free.

Among the most popular web-conferencing tools is Zoom. It has been well-known since 2013, however this 2020 it’s been one of the most used web-conferencing platforms. It can enable unlimited users worldwide to collaborate and attend meetings. With millions forced to stay at home as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, the 9-year-old platform has become a go-to service (Kelly, 2020). As well as providing a reliable platform for virtual meetings, it has been used for classroom lessons, church services, hanging out with friends, and even romantic dates.

#### Evolution of Web Conferencing Applications in the Workplace

Despite the fact that Zoom is the most widely used web conferencing program, some users feel it to be too easy because of its seemingly limited features. There are a number of comparable apps available currently, several of which have additional functionalities and properties that have added a better user-experience as a web conferencing software. One example of this would be __Gather Town__. Aside from the video and call option, there is also a virtual world present within the application. There are casual internet parties where you can virtually roam around a house as if you were at your own place.

Organizing, being productive, and being successful are all made possible through the use of this program through world building online. It's helpful for giving a sensation of "physical interaction” even if it’s in a virtual landscape.

If you prefer it to be in a 3D setting to make it feel more realistic, Mozilla Hubs, AltspaceVR, and Minecraft are all good options as well. World building is no longer new for certain platforms, and web conferencing has become an added bonus to foster organic interactions online. This goes to show that technology is constantly evolving, especially for web conferencing software.
