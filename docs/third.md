# Web & Video Conferencing and Working Spaces
### _by Yvonne Fudge Santos and Rajmyrr Suva_

_The pandemic has changed how the workforce operated worldwide. Many businesses closed as health protocols tightened. People were suddenly refrained from interacting with each other in the real world to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even news reporters–who did not stop a day of work–found a way to integrate their duties and set-up at their homes._

Many people have adapted and shifted to telecommuting or remote work, moving collaborative documents to online spaces, and meetings to video-conferencing applications. Most individuals utilized their spaces at home, and created a location in one of their rooms to be their designated work-place as the pandemic prolonged.

This did not only affect the corporate industries and its people, but has also impacted physical working spaces, co-working spaces, and other places that used to offer up their venues for rental for the workforce.


#### Working and Co-Working Spaces Before Pandemic

Working spaces were a norm in all industries in every country. Work-spaces are traditionally seen in an **office**.

A company or organization can have an office in a location where it has an official presence, even if that presence only includes a storage of products, rather than an official establishment with desks and chairs. The creation of offices dates back to the 18th century, right when the industrial era had become more developed; expanding banking, insurance, railways, petroleum, and many more industries. The role of an office is to create an environment to support its occupants in performing their job.

A **workspace** in an office generally fosters activities like reading, writing, printing, and computer work. 

An office may also provide meeting rooms, lounges, and even kitchens so workers can make their lunches.

As time progressed and start-ups and new business were developed, **co-working spaces** became a need. The essence of co-working started around 1999, in New York City when 42 West 24 provided flexible desks and working grounds for teams and individuals (Di Risio, 2021.) It was later further developed into the concept we know today in 2005 by Brad Neuberg (Neuberg, 2007). Neuberg was working at a start-up when he had the idea of co-working to combine the feeling of independence and community when working with others.

_Now, co-working spaces are places where anyone can work and be productive even if they belong to different corporations or industries._

It’s a flexible space that can act as an office for anyone, by providing resources like desks, tables, access to the internet, printers, charging panels, snacks, and more. 

Co-working is like a metaphorical public library where anyone can learn, study, and work on their own–while still being part of an unsaid community. 

Co-working spaces have become popular worldwide, catering to the following:
- businessmen
- freelance workers
- start-up employees
- students

But because of the pandemic, the concept of going to an office or renting a co-working space had drastically changed. 


#### Work from Home in the Pandemic

The work from home set-up is not new, however it became the norm for corporations when COVID-19 had begun spreading across every country mid-March of 2020. People have started remotely working from their own house, and the industry completely shifted.

They’ve provided internet access to every worker, and sometimes given them company laptops and gadgets so that they can work from their houses with ease. Everyday meetings and conferences shifted from being scheduled to a room, to becoming web-conference calls via Zoom, Google Meets, Skype, and more.

The use of emails has also been utilized to its full potential. According to an email statistics report there have been 4.03 billion email users in 2019 (Radicati Group Inc., 2021). However, because of the pandemic there was a rapid increase of users and emails sent last 2020. It’s been reported that there were 300.4 billion emails sent and received per day. This 2021 alone, there were 5.59 billion active email accounts worldwide. (Statista, 2020.)

The use of email has become prevalent to communicate and coordinate with companies, workers, employees, businesses, clients, and more. But aside from emails, another well known mode of communication the workforce turned to are Web Conferencing applications and software.
