# Web & Video Conferencing and Working Spaces
### _by Yvonne Fudge Santos and Rajmyrr Suva_

_The pandemic has changed how the workforce operated worldwide. Many businesses closed as health protocols tightened. People were suddenly refrained from interacting with each other in the real world to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even news reporters–who did not stop a day of work–found a way to integrate their duties and set-up at their homes._ 

Many people have adapted and shifted to telecommuting or remote work, moving collaborative documents to online spaces, and meetings to video-conferencing applications. Most individuals utilized their spaces at home, and created a location in one of their rooms to be their designated work-place as the pandemic prolonged.

  This did not only affect the corporate industries and its people, but has also impacted physical working spaces, co-working spaces, and other places that used to offer up their venues for rental for the workforce.

 
 

- **Working and Co-Working Spaces Before Pandemic**

Working spaces were a norm in all industries in every country. Work-spaces are traditionally seen in an office.

A company or organization can have an office in a location where it has an official presence, even if that presence only includes a storage of products, rather than an official establishment with desks and chairs. The creation of offices dates back to the 18th century, right when the industrial era had become more developed; expanding banking, insurance, railways, petroleum, and many more industries. The role of an office is to create an environment to support its occupants in performing their job.

A workspace in an office generally fosters activities like reading, writing, printing, and computer work. An office may also provide meeting rooms, lounges, and even kitchens so workers can make their lunches.

As time progressed and start-ups and new business were developed, co-working spaces became a need. The essence of co-working started around 1999, in New York City when 42 West 24 provided flexible desks and working grounds for teams and individuals. It was later further developed into the concept we know today in 2005 by Brad Neuberg. Neuberg was working at a start-up when he had the idea of co-working to combine the feeling of independence and community when working with others.

Now, co-working spaces are places where anyone can work and be productive even if they belong to different corporations or industries. It’s a flexible space that can act as an office for anyone, by providing resources like desks, tables, access to the internet, printers, charging panels, snacks, and more. Co-working is like a metaphorical public library where anyone can learn, study, and work on their own–while still being part of an unsaid community. Co-working spaces have become popular worldwide, catering to businessmen, freelance workers, start-up employees, and even students.

But because of the pandemic, the concept of going to an office or renting a co-working space had drastically changed.
