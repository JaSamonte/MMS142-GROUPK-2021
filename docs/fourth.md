# Web & Video Conferencing and Flight Services & Lodgings

People can connect with other individuals all over the world without the need for physical contact or engagement. Web conferencing saves customers a lot of money on travel costs and saves them from the inconveniences of travel including aircraft delays, cancellations, and traffic jams. Why travel when you can meet and conduct meetings virtually? 

Since web conferencing allows users to connect with other people around the globe without the need for physical contact or interaction, the demand for flight services declined. Also, the advancement of web/video conferencing services appears to be putting more pressure on flight services and lodgings, especially as these developments aim to promote remote work and provide users with flexible schedules, which creates an impact on corporate culture.

Furthermore, the pandemic is said to have accelerated this inevitability by giving people more reason to stay at home and utilize this technology in order to protect themselves.
