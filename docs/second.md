# Web & Video Conferencing and Regular Calls
## by Ariel Marie Sanchez and Isaiah Caleb A. Revilla

- **Video Conferencing Vs. Traditional Call Industry**

Before, regular calls or phone conferences through landline were the most efficient way of communication, especially in the corporate setting. By pressing a few buttons, people can converse with their loved ones, colleagues, and coworkers easily. However, the rise of cell phones has killed off the profusion of landlines. Video conferencing has an expansive edge over regular calls and one cannot deny to consider the beneficial and convenient shifts such as that it is beyond more engaging and productive, eliminates errors improving communication, establishes more personal connection, and reduces decision time making.  

The dawn of video conferencing now paved the way for both audio features and video features that landlines were not able to offer. Users can now visually engage with a single to multiple individuals at once. This new era spawned the great decline of landline industry and sales as the number of video conferencing users continues to increase. According to a US government study in 2018 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only around 5% of the survey population relied on a landline.

Some of the telephone companies disruptively affected by the advent of video conferencing are major competitors such as Motorola, VTech, Philips, Panasonic and Alcatel among many major competitors. This technological dynamic has forced these businesses to change the way they operate, barely hanging by the thread (Global Landline Phones Market Growth, 2021).
