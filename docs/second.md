# Web & Video Conferencing and Regular Calls

#### Web & Video Conferencing and Regular Calls

Before the global lockdown, people from all over the world still gathered in offices to attend meetings and communicate with each other directly even though video conferencing and phone communication already exists. There are things that only certain technologies or no technology can replicate when it comes to communication such as body language, emotion, tone, and context. If one wants to improve relations with clients and colleagues, a call or online video might not always be the best way.

But online communication kept progressing and now we can express even more of ourselves much clearer and in a way that other people might be able to relate using technologies such as _emotes_, _Zoom live meetings_, _Discord servers_ and others. 

During the pandemic period business communication apps have largely grown, as more nations participate in a global lockdown. Video conferencing went from an optional second-hand tool to the primary meeting method. People needed to meet without being physically present, so naturally we’d use what we have in hand… literally.

**Zoom** being accessible both on computer and mobile phones makes for a good example, it is a highly accessible app available in almost every operating system and available to the public for “free,” plus it is very user friendly. In other words it's convenient.

#### Video Conferencing’s Rise

Since corporations know that people want an easy access “no-brainer” or simple software that will allow them to talk or meet quick and simple it’s only natural that such applications such as Zoom are pushed to the top of the market. When people see that a product is efficient at filling a certain need, it will definitely circulate and become popular. 

Popularity comes with some consequences, though. With so many users on the platform many flaws in the system is inevitable such as _“Zoombombing”_ in Zoom or _account hacking_ on Facebook. This also causes competition to rise in the video conferencing world, since an active market is a good opportunity. More competitiors began to create different applications to join the business and our communication choices expanded.

#### Video Conferencing Vs. Traditional Call Industry

Before, regular calls or phone conferences through landline were the most efficient way of communication, especially in the corporate setting. By pressing a few buttons, people can converse with their loved ones, colleagues, and coworkers easily. However, the rise of cell phones has killed off the profusion of landlines. Video conferencing has an expansive edge over regular calls and one cannot deny to consider the beneficial and convenient shifts such as that it is beyond more engaging and productive, eliminates errors improving communication, establishes more personal connection, and reduces decision time making.  

The dawn of video conferencing now paved the way for both audio features and video features that landlines were not able to offer. Users can now visually engage multiple individuals at once. This new era spawned the great decline of landline industry and sales as the number of video conferencing users continues to increase. According to a US government study in 2018 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only around 5% of the survey population relied on a landline.

Some of the telephone companies disruptively affected by the advent of video conferencing such as Motorola, VTech, Philips, Panasonic and Alcatel among many major competitors. This technological dynamic has forced these businesses to change the way they operate, barely hanging by the thread (Global Landline Phones Market Growth, 2021).
