# Web & Video Conferencing and Regular Calls
### *by Ariel Marie Sanchez and Caleb Revilla*

**Web & Video Conferencing and Regular Calls**

Before the global lockdown people from all over the world still gathered in offices to attend meetings and communicate with each other directly even though video conferencing and phone communication was already an everyday thing. There are things that only certain technologies or no technology can replicate when it comes to communication such as body language, emotion, context, if you want to improve relations with your clients and colleagues through a call or online video might not be the best way.

But online communication just keeps progressing and now we can express even more of ourselves much clearer and in a way that other people might be able to relate using technologies such as emotes, Zoom live meeting, Discord communication servers and others. 

During the pandemic period business communication apps have largely grown, as more nations participate in global lockdown. Video conferencing went from an optional second-hand tool to the primary meeting method.  People needed to meet without the need of being physically present; naturally we’d use what we have in hand… literally.
Zoom being accessible both on computer and mobile phones makes for a good example, it is a highly accessible app available in almost every operating system and available to the public for the good-good price of “free” plus it is easy to get into and understand. In other words it's convenient.

- **Video Conferencing’s Rise**

Since corporations know that people want an easy access “no-brainer” slash simple software that will allow them to talk or meet quick and simple it’s only natural that such applications such as Zoom are pushed to the top of trending, when people have a need and they know about something that fills that need that does a good job at it it will definitely circulate. Popularity comes with some consequences though, with so many users on the platform many flaws in the system will be exposed such as “zoombombing” in Zoom or account hacking in facebook. This also causes competition to rise in the video conferencing world, an active market is a good opportunity and our communication choices greatly expand as more competitors join the business.

“Why is this a disruptive technology? Regular calls just aren’t the same anymore, we went from landline to cell service credit to wireless online connections. People have already been communicating through the internet on a regular, sometimes even daily basis. The pandemic just closed the other options. Because many people lost access to long range traveling it was only second nature that people would look to the next best and affordable technology available”

**Video Conferencing Vs. Traditional Call Industry**

Before, regular calls or phone conferences through landline were the most efficient way of communication, especially in the corporate setting. By pressing a few buttons, people can converse with their loved ones, colleagues, and coworkers easily. However, the rise of cell phones has killed off the profusion of landlines. Video conferencing has an expansive edge over regular calls and one cannot deny to consider the beneficial and convenient shifts such as that it is beyond more engaging and productive, eliminates errors improving communication, establishes more personal connection, and reduces decision time making.  

The dawn of video conferencing now paved the way for both audio features and video features that landlines were not able to offer. Users can now visually engage with a single to multiple individuals at once. This new era spawned the great decline of landline industry and sales as the number of video conferencing users continues to increase. According to a US government study in 2018 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only around 5% of the survey population relied on a landline.

Some of the telephone companies disruptively affected by the advent of video conferencing are major competitors such as Motorola, VTech, Philips, Panasonic and Alcatel among many major competitors. This technological dynamic has forced these businesses to change the way they operate, barely hanging by the thread (Global Landline Phones Market Growth, 2021).
